# Some Posts From My Old Blog

As I mentioned in my first post, I had an earlier blog with a number of entries about building handmade turnouts. Unfortunately the blogs' Wordpress database got borked so I had to start again, but I did manage to retrieve many of the posts.

So without further ado I'll put them back up.

##### Post 1 from my old blog - building hand made turnouts:

Even though I have been interested in building an n scale model railroad layout for quite a while now, what really got me interested again were sites [like this] or [this] and especially [this guy] have been building their own turnouts. 
 
They made it look rather easy and they certainly look much better than store bought turnouts, so I was determined to give it a try. This also fits in with my interest of doing as much as I can rather than buying it.

So over Christmas I gave it a go. Armed with a new file and some old code 80 flextrack I began my first adventure into model railroading...
