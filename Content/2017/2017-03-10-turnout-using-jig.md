# First Turnouts Using Dremel Tool Jig

Here is a picture of the first set of points made with the turnout jig and proper materials. This took about 3 hours to make. I think it turned out pretty well.

I also experimented a bit with what sort of base to put the points on. Here I am using cork. The PC ties are a bit thinner than the wooden sleepers, so I used a shim and glued the turnout to the cork only at 4 of the PC ties. The wooden sleepers just slide under the rail and are glued to the cork only. This should make it easy to remove the turnout from the base if necessary.

Here is another set of points, this time mounted on rubber and wood. A bit more solid, but I am starting to think its best just to leave the points 'bare' and just glue them down (at the PC ties) where needed. A bit depends on how I eventually get the points to move.
