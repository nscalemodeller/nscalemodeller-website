# Software Available

I've added the software that I have been developing to my GitHub repository. The link can be found on the [Software Downloads] page.

The repository contains a simple Arduino sketch to send a DCC signal to a booster, a very simple ‘booster tester’ that just flips the port connected to the booster every 5 seconds (basically a modified ‘blink’ sketch) so that you can measure the booster output with a multimeter, and a very early version of my MacDCC Command Station software.
